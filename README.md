This is our data extraction from the website https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Summer_Olympics_medal_table#cite_note-1 which shows the results from the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics. There is a table which shows the 5 countries who had the most total Olympic medals and in any case of a tie the country with more gold medals was ranked higher. There is an image of LÃ©on Marchand who won the most gold medals (4) of any athlete who competed. Finally, there is a paragraph that summarizes the Olympic games.
